# PacMen
## This project creates PacMan projectiles and moves them around the screen with random direction and velocity, while staying within the boundaries of the screen edges. 

#### To run this project locally download the html file, js file, and PacMan1.png. To view in your broswer, navigate to the GitHub Page for this project. https://hilaryvoegeli.github.io/PacMen/
#### In the future it would be fun if the pacmen faced the direction they were traveling.
