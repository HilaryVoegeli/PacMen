# PacMen
## This project creates PacMan projectiles and moves them around the screen with random direction and velocity, while staying within the screen boundaries. 

#### To run this project download the html file, js file, and PacMan1.png. Open the files in VS code to modifiy the code and use your browser to see the map in action. 
#### In the future it would be fun if the pacmen faced the direction they were traveling.
