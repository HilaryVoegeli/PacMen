# PacMen
## This project creates PacMan projectiles that move around the screen with random direction and velocity, while staying within the boundaries of the screen edges. 

#### To run: clone the repository, drag and drop the HTML file into your web browser. Or navigate to the GitHub Page: https://hilaryvoegeli.github.io/PacMen/
#### In the future it would be fun if the pacmen faced the direction they were traveling.
